Imagism before the Blast: Avant-garde London, 1908-16

"Imagism before the Blast: Avant-garde London, 1908-16" is a digital humanities project that works to map places and archive material pivotal to the artistic renaissance that took place in London, England, in the years leading up to the First World War. Consequently, identifying, collecting, annotating, and linking texts—and works of art—to London’s geographic grid, will allow for changing notions of what a literary and artistic experience constitutes through the frame of contemporary technological advancements. Further, the creation of a digital space—anchored in early twentieth-century London—will allow for a multidimensional experience of Modernism that expands upon traditional interactions with art and literature from the period. After identifying, and mapping, elements of London’s social fabric that served as the basis for a flourishing of arts and letters, the project will then move to address three foundational questions: First, why did modern London serve as the geographic site for an artistic renaissance? Second, what was it about the transitional years, 1908 to 1916 that allowed the artistic flourishing to occur? And, finally, what characteristics did the historical figures involved with the Imagist and Vorticist movements, embody, that allowed the small collectives to prosper? Taken as a whole, the goal is to unpack the creative connections, spaces, and publications that made London the hub of cultural activity in the English-speaking world after the Fin de Siècle.
